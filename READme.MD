PDS Assignment 1:

This repository contains solutions for two data analysis tasks implemented using a structured workflow: Ingest → Process → Analyze.

In Question 1, the frailty dataset was cleaned and standardized by converting height and weight units, computing BMI, categorizing age groups,
and encoding categorical variables. Summary statistics were generated
and the relationship between grip strength and frailty was analyzed using correlation.
The results indicate that lower grip strength is associated with higher frailty.

In Question 2, the student performance dataset was preprocessed and an overall average score was created.
Five visualizations were produced at 800×600 pixels and 300 DPI to examine gender differences, the impact of test preparation, lunch type effects,
subject correlations, and the relationship between math and reading scores. The analysis shows strong correlations among subjects and improved performance
for students who completed test preparation.

Tools used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
